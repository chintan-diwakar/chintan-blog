Welcome to my blog.

This is where I'll be sharing:

- **Technical deep-dives** - Breaking down complex topics in AI, LLMs, and software engineering
- **Project writeups** - Behind-the-scenes on tools and products I build
- **Lessons learned** - What worked, what didn't, and why

## What's Coming

I'm working on a few exciting posts:

1. Building AI agents with LangGraph
2. Privacy-first approaches to code analysis
3. Shipping fast: from idea to production

Stay tuned.
